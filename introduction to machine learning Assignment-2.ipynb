A model with high bias makes strong assumptions about the underlying patterns in the data, often leading to oversimplified representations of the true relationship between features and target.<br>\n",
    "- **Effect on Model Performance:** High bias models tend to underfit the data, meaning they perform poorly on both the training and test data because they fail to capture the true complexity of the underlying patterns.\n",

    "- **Effect on Model Performance:** High variance models tend to overfit the data, meaning they perform well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data because they have essentially memorized the noise in the training data.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "### Relationship between Bias and Variance<br>\n",
    "- **Inversely Related:** Bias and variance are typically inversely related in machine learning models. As you decrease bias, you tend to increase variance, and vice versa.<br>\n",
    "- **Optimal Balance:** The goal is to find the optimal balance between bias and variance that minimizes the model's overall error on new, unseen data.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "### Impact on Model Performance<br>\n",
    "- **Underfitting (High Bias):** Models with high bias have poor performance on both training and test data because they oversimplify the underlying patterns.<br>\n",

    "Plotting the learning curves of the model during training can reveal insights into overfitting and underfitting. Learning curves show the model's performance (e.g., accuracy or loss) on both the training set and validation set as training progresses. If the training and validation curves diverge significantly, it indicates overfitting. If both curves are stagnating at low performance, it suggests underfitting.\n",

    "Regularization in machine learning is a set of techniques used to prevent overfitting by adding additional constraints or penalties to the model during training. Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too complex and fits the noise or random fluctuations in the training data rather than the underlying patterns. Regularization helps in controlling model complexity and encourages it to learn the most important features while reducing the impact of irrelevant or noisy features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Regularization Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>1. **L1 Regularization (Lasso):**\n",
    "   - L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute values of the model's coefficients.\n",
    "   - The penalty term encourages some of the coefficients to become exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection and keeping only the most important features.\n",
    "   - L1 regularization is particularly useful when there are many irrelevant or redundant features in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>2. **L2 Regularization (Ridge):**\n",
    "   - L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the model's coefficients.\n",
    "   - The penalty term smoothens the coefficients, making them less sensitive to the fluctuations in the training data.\n",
    "   - L2 regularization is effective in reducing the impact of multicollinearity, where features are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>3. **Elastic Net Regularization:**\n",
    "   - Elastic Net is a combination of L1 and L2 regularization. It adds both penalty terms to the model's coefficients, controlling model complexity while also performing feature selection.\n",
    "   - Elastic Net provides a balance between the sparsity-inducing property of L1 regularization and the smoothing property of L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>4. **Dropout (for Neural Networks):**\n",
    "   - Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning models, particularly in neural networks.\n",
    "   - During training, a fraction of neurons is randomly dropped out or deactivated with a certain probability. This prevents neurons from becoming overly reliant on each other, improving the generalization of the model.\n",
    "   - Dropout acts as an ensemble of multiple subnetworks, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>5. **Early Stopping:**\n",
    "   - Early stopping is a simple regularization technique that involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training.\n",
    "   - Training is stopped when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade, preventing the model from overfitting to the training data.\n"
